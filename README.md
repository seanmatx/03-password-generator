# 03-Password-Generator

## I need another password

This assignment prompts a user to consider the characters and length they want with a password. When a user clicks the button, they will be prompted to ask the length of passwords, and sequentially if they would like uppercase characters, lowercase characters, numbers, and/or symbols. After confirming the length of the password and if it should (or should not) include any of the categories of characters, the app presents a random password that the user has requested based on the length and types of characters needed.
